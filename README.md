# A Guide to setting up your developer environment

[![contributions welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/contributions-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/JaipurJS/dev-setup/issues)

_Note:_ The intention is **not** to include every fancy script, tip and trick under the sun, this is about **basic setup and getting going when you're new** and already have a _steep_ learning curve!

## Who is this for?
People who are new to coding.    
Particularly people who have learnt online using inbuilt browser-based editors and tools (often the case in online courses) and have **not set up their own environment on their own computers** before.

## Why?
When we were teaching ourselves how to code it took us some time, talking to more experienced developers and trying things out to **pick up on all the small things that make our lives easier as developers**.   
We wanted there to be a single place where new developers could go to find these quickly so they can **get past the setup and down to the business of coding**.
